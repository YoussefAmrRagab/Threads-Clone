Welcome to our sample Flutter application that demonstrates how to retrieve and display data from the JSONPlaceholder API with a modern and structured approach. This app allows users to explore posts and their associated comments.

## Features

- Fetch posts and comments from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Display posts on the home screen, including user information.
- View comments for each post on a separate screen.
- Animated splash screen using Lottie.
- State management with GetX.
- Data fetching using the http library.
- Utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for structured code.

## MVC Architecture

This project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to maintain a clean and organized codebase. The responsibilities are divided as follows:

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic. In this project, it includes data models for posts, comments, and users.

- **View:** Represents the user interface components. The UI elements for displaying posts, comments, and user information on screens.

- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary, handling user input and updating the model and view accordingly. Controllers manage the flow of data between the model and view components.
